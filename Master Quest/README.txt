This mod 


[INSTALL]
Simply merge the Rain World folder of the mod, with the same folder in your install. It will 
ask to replace several files if done correctly. This mod is unlikely to be 

Attempting to install more than one region mod is a bit complex, but if the other region does not
have the same connections as the one you are trying to merge it with, it should be as simple as
dragging both into your install, and then ensuring both the "Rain World\World\Regions\regions.txt"
has both region prefixes present, and "Rain World\World\Gates\locks.txt" has the gate values of 
both mods present. You will need to do these last two steps manually, as your install will only 
have the data for the last region mod merged into it.
