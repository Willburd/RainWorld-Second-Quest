===<Master Quest>===
Ver. 1.0
RAIN WORLD v1.5
VANILLA+



[DESCRIPTION]
NOTICE! Be sure to backup your saves before installing! Having a clean save is recommended!

This mod is an attempt to bring back the feelings of first playing Rain World. The intent is 
to offer a sort of "Second Quest" to long time players. Where they can explore Rain World from
the ground up for a second time. Similar to the way that the Master Quest version of Ocarina of Time
offered players remixed dungeons, and the second quest of the original Zelda shuffled both dungeon
locations, and the layout of those dungeons!

While not intended for a first time player. The difficulty is not meant to be anything worse than 
vanilla. However some of the new region layouts and connections can provide a new challenge all
on their own. Expect the unexpected!



[INSTALL]
Simply merge the World folder of the mod, with the same folder in your install. It will 
ask to replace several files if done correctly. This mod is unlikely to be compatible with
any region mods. However this mode makes no edits to the dll. So you can use any non-region
mods on top of this, such as Dungeon World, or Lancer. I've not tested these however!

If you are already using partiality, it is recommended that you get the checksum fix mod to stop 
the game from panicking on launch. If you want to run pure-vanilla without modding. You only need 
to go to the options menu and change files to disable the checksum panic at the title screen.

The install cannot be undone unless you made a backup of your world before it, or verify the 
game's files through steam for a complete reinstall.

[DEV NOTES - Spoilers]
I am sorry for Sky Islands.
Five Pebbles was the most fun to reorganize
I love what I did with Drainage System, and Industrial Complex a lot!
The Exterior feels a little disappointing, but there isn't much I can work with.
Yes I know I didn't test monk, but the creature density is so low anyway, and I already know about the spots I needed to change in Five Pebbles.
